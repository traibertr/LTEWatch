\section{Small Watch Application Development}

The second biggest task of of this project is to develop a simple watch application for the prototype board of \textit{LTEWatch}. Due to the limited time available for the project, the objectif is not to develop a definitive and complex smart-watch application but is to implement every functional blocks from the prototype board, because of this, the developed application is name "\textit{PicoWatch}".\\

Following the system functional decomposition (p.:\pageref{sec:sys_func_dec}), the small watch application 
(\textit{PicoWatch}), is decomposed in the following functional blocks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Power Supply}: Relating to battery and charger module
\item \textbf{User Interface}: Relating to user-accessible peripherals and sensors
\item \textbf{RF \& Network}: Relating to \textit{LTE-M/NB-IoT}, \textit{MQTT} and \textit{GNSS}
\item \textbf{Debugging}: Relating to \textsc{VS-Code} \textit{IDE} logging
\end{enumerate}

This block is one of the most important in the device, as it basically defines the name of the project. By integrating the \textit{LTE-M/NB-Iot} modem, the \textit{MQTT} client and the \textit{GNSS} receiver module of the \textit{LTEWatch} prototype board, this block should implement the following features:

\subsection{Application Functional Decomposition Diagram}

In order to have a more visual understanding of the application, it is interesting to decompose the application software in a functional block diagram that illustrates each block with its correspond pin assignment. With this diagram, it is easier to understand which \textit{API}, library and peripherals need to be implemented to integrate each features. \\

Figure \ref{fig:software_diag} illustrates the functional decomposition diagram of \textit{LTEWatch} application software:

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Include/Figure/software/software_diag.pdf}
	\caption{\textit{LTEWatch} Application Functional Decomposition Diagram}
	\label{fig:software_diag}
\end{figure}

As shown in figure \ref{fig:software_diag}, even if the goal of the firmware development is to implement a small watch application to validate prototype board hardware and features, the \textit{LTEWatch} application (firmware) is already quite complex and requires to implement several  peripherals.\\

The small watch application firmware (\textit{LTEWatch}) require following peripherals to be implemented:
\begin{itemize}
\item many digital inputs and outputs for LEDs, motors and command signals,
\item several interrupt sensitive digital inputs for external modules and buttons,
\item an analog input (\textit{ADC}) for battery level monitoring (AIN3),
\item two \textit{UART} serial bus for the \textit{FTDI} interface and the \textit{GNSS} receiver,
\item a \textit{I2C} serial bus for the battery charger and the \textit{GNSS} receiver,
\item a \textit{SPI} serial bus for the display and the accelerometer,
\item and a \textit{LTE Modem} for \textit{LTE-M/NB-IoT} RF communication.
\end{itemize}

\section{\textit{LTEWatch} Software Architecture}

As seen in the "\textit{LTEWatch Application Decomposition}" section starting at page \pageref{sec:ltewatch_app_decomp}, the developed application is relatively complex and integrates multiple components and features. For better understanding, a visual illustration of the developed firmware architecture is shown in figure \ref{fig:software_layers}:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Include/Figure/software/software_layers.pdf}
	\caption{\textit{LTEWatch} Software Architecture}
	\label{fig:software_layers}
\end{figure}

As shown in figure \ref{fig:software_layers}, the application requires the integration of many \textit{APIs} from the \textsc{Nordic Semiconductor} \textit{nrfx} driver set. These \textit{API} are either directly used by the \textit{LTEWatch} application, or required by the \textit{Zephyr} \textit{RTOS} which is the main component of the software.\\

The \textit{LTEWatch} firmware is an event-based application. This means that each process is triggered by events such as timeout triggered, \textit{GPIO} triggered or software triggered events. Since the application needs to be as responsive as possible, every submitted event needs to be stored, executed, and disposed of by an event manager unit, also known as an executive framework.\\

The \textit{Institute of Industrial System} of the \textit{HES-SO Wallis (HEVS)} has developed its own executive framework: \textbf{\textit{eXecution Framework}(\textit{XF})}. This \textit{XF} is used by the \textit{LTEWatch} firmware to implement an event-based application. Besides the integrated \textit{XF}, a more compact and simpler version of external framework \textit{PicoXF} is implemented for reasons that will be covered later.

\subsection{Introduction to \textit{nRF Connect SDK} from \textsc{Nordic Semi.}}

Before diving into the \textit{LTEWatch} firmware, it seems worth having a good understanding of the \textit{nRF Connect SDK} of \textsc{Nordic Semi}.\\

\textit{nRF Connect SDK} is an open-source and optimized cellular IoT (\textit{LTE-M}/\textit{NB-IoT}), \textit{Bluetooth Low Energy}, \textit{Thread}, \textit{Zigbee}, and \textit{Bluetooth mesh stacks} software development kit which includes the \textit{Zephyr} real-time operating system (\textit{RTOS}). The \textsc{nRF Connect SDK} enables to develop application for nRF52, nRF53, and nRF91 Series devices. The \textit{nRF Connect SDK} source code is fully accessible on \textsc{Nordic Semi.}'s \textit{"nrfconnect"} repository: \url{https://github.com/nrfconnect}.

\begin{flushleft}
The \textit{nRF Connect SDK} from \textsc{Nordic Semi.} contains the following modules:
\end{flushleft}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{sdk-nrf \textit{(nrfx)} : }Contains applications, samples, libraries, and drivers that are specifically targeted for Nordic Semiconductor devices.
\item \textbf{sdk-nrfxlib \textit{(nrfxlib)} :} Contains closed-source libraries and modules in binary format.
\item \textbf{sdk-zephyr \textit{(Zephyr RTOS)} :} Contains a fork of the \textit{Zephyr} project, which provides samples, libraries, and drivers for a wide variety of devices, including Nordic Semiconductor devices.
\item \textbf{sdk-mcuboot \textit{(mcuboot)}:} Contains a fork of the \textit{MCUboot} project, which provides a secure bootloader application. You can find the fork in \codeword{bootloader/mcuboot} after obtaining the \textsc{nRF Connect SDK} source code.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textsc{Nordic Semi.} Driver Package (\textit{nrfx})}
\subsubsection{Overview:}
The replacement of the old \textit{"nRF5 SDK"} from \textsc{Nordic Semi.} with the new \textit{"nRF Connect SDK"} required to export all the drivers from their previous \textit{SDK} to ensure compatibility with previously developed applications, or at leas to facilitate as much as possible port to the new \textit{SDK}.\\

In the new \textit{nRF Connect SDK}, \textsc{Nordic Semi.}'s SoCs peripherals drivers are contained in \textit{nrfx}. \textsc{Nordic Semi.} also wanted to provide drivers that could be used in various environments without needing to integrate other parts of \textit{SDK}, if unnecessary, that's why they regrouped all drivers in \textit{nrfx}. \\

More detailed information about \textit{nrfx} is available on their online documentation: \url{https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrfx/index.html}.

\subsubsection{SoC Driver Compatibility Comparison Table:}
Before using any drivers or \textit{APis} from \textit{nrfx}, it is necessary to understand which drivers are supported by which SoC, in this case the \textit{nRF9160 SiP}.\\

The comparative overview of drivers compatibility of each SoCs from \textsc{Nordic Semi.} is presented in the following table \ref{tab:nrfx_driver_tab}:

\subsection{Board Description in \textit{Zephyr RTOS} - (Devicetree)}

The section if based on the online documentation "Introduction to devicetree"\cite{dtinro} from \textsc{Nordi Semi.}

\subsubsection{Overview:}
A specific aspect of developing with \textit{Zephyr RTOS} is that the hardware is fully described \textit{Devicetree}, which is a hierarchical data structure. Zephyr uses \textit{Devicetree} to
describe hardware to the \textit{Device Driver Model} as well as the initial configuration of that hardware.

\begin{flushleft}
\textit{Devicetree} can be described using two type of input files:
\end{flushleft}
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item \textit{devicetree sources}: Actual description of the \textit{devicetree} itself
 \item \textit{devicetree bindings}: Description of contents and data types of \textit{devicetree}
 \end{enumerate}
 
 Those two files are combined by \textit{build system} to produce a generated C header that is abstracted by the \codeword{devicetree.h} \textit{API}. Simplified diagram of the \textit{devicetree} build process is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:zephyr_dt_build_flow}:
 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Include/Figure/software/zephyr_dt_build_flow.png}
	\caption{Simplified \textit{Devicetree} build flow - Source:\cite{dtintro}}
	\label{fig:zephyr_dt_build_flow}
\end{figure}

\warning{\textbf{Warning}: It is necessary to include \textit{devicetree.h} in any  \textit{Zephyr} and application source code that need to access or use the \textit{devicetree}}

\subsubsection{Syntax and structure:}
The human-readable text of the \textit{Devicetree} is called \textit{Device Tree Source} \textit{DTS}.\\
An example \textit{DTS} file is illustrated in the listing \ref{lst:dts_ex}:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:dts_ex},caption={Example \textit{DTS} File - Source:\cite{dtintro}}]
/{
	a-node {
					subnode_nodelabel: a-sub-node {
							foo = <3>;
					};
	};
};
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{flushleft}
The structure of \textit{devicetree} is composed of three nodes:
\end{flushleft}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A root node: \codeword{/}
\item A node named \codeword{a-node}, which is a child of the root node
\item A node named \codeword{a-sub-node}, which is a child of \codeword{a-node}
\end{enumerate}
\;\\[-40pt]
\subsubsection{Aliases and chosen nodes:}
It possible to refer to a specific node without specifying its entire path using \codeword{aliases} or \codeword{chosen} nodse. An example of \textit{DTS} using both methods is illustrated in listing \ref{lst:aliases_chosen_node}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:aliases_chosen_node},caption={Example \textit{DTS} File using \textit{chosen} and \textit{aliases} nodes - Source:\cite{dt_zephyr_user}}]
/ {
	chosen {
				zephyr,console = &uart0;
	};
	aliases {
				my-uart = &uart0;
	};
	soc {
			uart0: serial@12340000 {
                     ...
			};
	};
};
\end{lstlisting}
\;\\[-60pt]
\subsubsection{\textit{zephyr,user} node:}

The \codeword{zephyr,user} node is a very useful node that can be used to describe essentially arbitrary properties that can be retrieve without requiring binding files. It can be compared to a convenient container to store few simple properties.

The \codeword{zephyr,user} node can store three types of properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Simple values:} numeric or array values that are configurate at build time via \textit{devicetree}
\item \textbf{Devices:} phandles that allows to reconfigure which devices the application uses in simple cases using devicetree overlays
\item \textbf{GPIOs:} Application-specific \textit{GPIOs} that can be reconfigured with a \textit{devicetree} overlay
\end{enumerate}

The three types of properties are illustrated in listings \ref{lst:zephyr_user_simpl_val} to \ref{lst:zephyr_user_gpios}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:zephyr_user_simpl_val},caption={Example \textit{zephyr,user} Node - Simple Value Properties - Source:\cite{dt_zephyr_user}}]
/ {
     zephyr,user {
             boolean;
             bytes = [81 82 83];
             number = <23>;
             numbers = <1>, <2>, <3>;
             string = "text";
             strings = "a", "b", "c";
     };
};
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:zephyr_user_dev},caption={Example \textit{zephyr,user} Node - Devices Properties}]
/ {
     zephyr,user {
             handle = <&gpio0>;
             handles = <&gpio0>, <&gpio1>;
     };
};
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:zephyr_user_gpios},caption={Example \textit{zephyr,user} Node - \textit{GPIOs} Properties - Source:\cite{dt_zephyr_user}}]

/ {
     zephyr,user {
             signal-gpios = <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
     };
};
\end{lstlisting}

Listings \ref{lst:zephyr_user_retr_sim_val} to \ref{lst:zephyr_user_retr_gpios} illustrates how to retrieve property values from \codeword{zephyr,user} node in application \textit{C/C++} files:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:zephyr_user_retr_sim_val},caption={Example \textit{zephyr,user} Node - \textit{GPIOs} Properties - Source:\cite{dt_zephyr_user}}]
#define ZEPHYR_USER_NODE DT_PATH(zephyr_user)

DT_PROP(ZEPHYR_USER_NODE, bytes)   // {0x81, 0x82, 0x83}
DT_PROP(ZEPHYR_USER_NODE, number)  // 23
DT_PROP(ZEPHYR_USER_NODE, numbers) // {1, 2, 3}
DT_PROP(ZEPHYR_USER_NODE, string)  // "text"
DT_PROP(ZEPHYR_USER_NODE, strings) // {"a", "b", "c"}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Custom Board Creation Process:}

Using the pin assignment of the \textit{LTEWatch} prototype board (table \ref{tab:gpio_ltewatch_board}), a custom devicetree board "\codeword{ltewatch_nrf9160_ns}" was created. The process used to create the custom board is described in \textsc{Nordic Semi.} tutorial video "\textit{Getting started with custom development in nRF Connect SDK}": \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSivO9Cf1TE}.\\

The custom board creation process presented in the tutorial is fairly simple:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Duplicate an already existing board with identical SoC. For \textit{LTEWatch}, the \textit{nrf9160dk} development board description, "\codeword{nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns}", was used.
\item In the duplicate folder, rename each mention of the previous board with the new name of the board. Be careful to rename everything correctly.
\item After renaming, remove any unnecessary definitions or descriptions and adapt the remaining ones to suit the new board hardware.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Devicetree overlays:}
In \textit{Zephyr}, \textit{devicetree} overlays are used to reconfigure proprieties defined in \textit{DTS}. The overlay is only used in the application environment and must be described in the root (\textit{src}) directory of the project. To reconfigure a node in the \textit{DT} overlay, à "\&" symbol must be added in front of the node label. Listing \ref{lst:overlay_ex} illustrates an example of \textit{DT} overlay:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:overlay_ex},caption={\textit{DT} Overlay Example}]
&i2c0 {
       temp: temperature-sensor@76 {
                compatible = "vnd,some-sensor";
                reg = <0x76>;
       };
};
\end{lstlisting}

The propriety described in listing \ref{lst:overlay_ex} can be accessed in the \textit{C/C++} application using the macro: \codeword{DT_ON_BUS(DT_NODELABEL(temp), i2c)}.

\section{\textit{LTEWatch} Application Firmware}
This section describes the \textit{LTEWatch} application firmware that was developed for the prototype board.

\subsection{Application System Configuration:}
The first steps of the firmware development are the application configuration using the project \textit{Kconfig} file and the hardware description using the project's board \textit{Devicetree} overlay file.

\subsubsection{Kconfig:}

The \textit{LTEWatch} application uses multiple drivers and libraries that require to enable \textit{C} and \textit{C++} library from \textit{Zephyr}. The configuration of \textit{C/C++} library is illustrated in the listing \ref{lst:clib_conf}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={lst:clib_conf},caption={Application \textit{C} library Configuration}]
# ******************************************** #
# C Library                                    #
# ******************************************** #
CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC=y
CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC_NANO=n
CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC_FLOAT_PRINTF=y

# ******************************************** #
# C++                                          #
# ******************************************** #
CONFIG_CPLUSPLUS=y
CONFIG_LIB_CPLUSPLUS=y
\end{lstlisting}

In order to avoid unexpected comportment during the development state of the firmware, the build optimization is disabled and reset on fatal error is enabled. To use certain drivers, the \textit{C++} library and more particularly \textit{POO}, \textit{Zephyr} requires to enable \textit{C++} exceptions.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={lst:sys_conf},caption={Application System Configuration}]
# ******************************************** #
# Compiler Optimization                        #
# ******************************************** #
CONFIG_NO_OPTIMIZATIONS=y

# ******************************************** #
# Exception                                    #
# ******************************************** #
CONFIG_EXCEPTIONS=y

# ******************************************** #
# FATAL ERROR Management                       #
# ******************************************** #
CONFIG_RESET_ON_FATAL_ERROR=y
\end{lstlisting}

\textit{Zephyr RTOS} and \textit{XF} requires multiple kind of queues and memory allocation process. For this reason the application memory allocation must be configured. To be more precise, the size of following memory blocks must be configured:
\begin{itemize}
\item Application Main Stack :  Main stack memory allocated for static elements of the application
\item AT Monitor Heap : Heap memory used by the \textit{LTE} Modem to queue dynamic elements
\item Heap Memory Pool : Heap memory used by the executive framework and the \textit{RTOS} for dynamic elements handling, such as events and threads management
\item System Work-queue Stack : Memory allocated to the main system work-queue from \textit{Zephyr}\\
\end{itemize} 

Memory allocation of the \textit{LTEWatch} firmware is described in the listing \ref{lst:memory_conf}:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={lst:memory_conf},caption={Application Memory Configuration}]
# ********************************************* #
# Heap and stacks                               #
# ********************************************* #
CONFIG_MAIN_STACK_SIZE=12288
CONFIG_AT_MONITOR_HEAP_SIZE=512
CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE=8192
#stack size of system k_work queue
CONFIG_SYSTEM_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE=8192
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Digital I/O - \textit{GPIO}:}
As mentioned in multiple times, the \textit{LTEWatch} application used several \textit{GPIOs} of the \textit{nRF9160 SiP}. In \textit{Zephyr}, \textit{GPIOs} must be described in the application \textit{Devicetree} and must be enabled in the \textit{Kconfig} file.

\subsubsection{Devicetree:}
To use \textit{GPIOs} in \textit{Zephyr RTOS}, it is simply necessary to enable the \textit{GPIO HAL API} and the \textit{GPIOTE HAL API} in the application \textit{DTS} or \textit{DT} overlay. The \textit{DT} overlay description of \textit{GPIOs} is illustrated in listing \ref{lst:gpio_def}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:gpio_def},caption={\textit{DT} \textit{GPIOs} Description}]
&gpiote {
	status = "okay";
};

&gpio0 {
    status = "okay";
};
\end{lstlisting}

\pagebreak

To fully benefit from the \textit{Devicetree} provided by \textit{Zephyr}, some macros are defined using the \codeword{zephyr,user} node. Macros description using \codeword{zephyr,user} node is illustrated in the listing \ref{lst:parma_def}:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:parma_def},caption={\textit{DT} \textit{GPIOs} Proprieties Description}]
/ {
	zephyr,user {
		// Led
		led-max-number  = <3>;
		// Button
		button-max-number  = <3>;
	 };
};
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Kconfig:}

Once \textit{GPIOs} are described in the application \textit{Devicetree} it is still necessary to enable \textit{GPIOs} in the application \textit{Kconfig} as shown in listing \ref{lst:gpio_conf}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={lst:gpio_conf},caption={Application \textit{GPIOs} Configuration}]
# ********************************************* #
# GPIO                                          #
# ********************************************* #
CONFIG_GPIO=y
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Analog Input - \textit{ADC}:}
To use the \textit{ADC}, the process is very similar to that of the \textit{GPIOs}, namely description in the application \textit{Devicetree} and activation of the \textit{API} in the application \textit{Kconfig} .
\subsubsection{Devicetree:}

For the \textit{LTEWatch} application, the \textit{ADC} input \textit{AIN3} with the configuration shown in the listing \ref{lst:adc_def}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:adc_def},caption={\textit{DT} \textit{ADC} Description}]
&adc {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
    status = "okay";

	channel@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		zephyr,gain = "ADC_GAIN_1_5";
		zephyr,reference = "ADC_REF_INTERNAL";
		zephyr,acquisition-time = <ADC_ACQ_TIME_DEFAULT>;
		zephyr,input-positive = <NRF_SAADC_AIN3>;  // P0.16 = AIN3
		zephyr,resolution = <12>;
	};
};

\end{lstlisting}

As before, some macros are defined in the application \textit{Devicetree} using the \codeword{zephyr,user} node as shown in listing \ref{lst:adc_prop_def}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:adc_prop_def},caption={\textit{DT} \textit{ADC} Proprieties Description}]
/ {
	zephyr,user {
		io-channels = <&adc 3>; // P0.16 = AIN3
		// Display
		// Battery Manager
		bat-lvl-gpios	 = <&gpio0 12 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		batlvl-en-gpios   = <&gpio0 11 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		batchrg-int-gpios = <&gpio0 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	 };
};
\end{lstlisting}
\;\\[-50pt]
\subsubsection{Kconfig:}
On the \textit{nRF9160 SiP} \textit{ADC} requier to enable both \textit{ADC} and \textit{SAADC}, as shown in the listing \ref{lst:adc_conf}:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={lst:adc_conf},caption={Application \textit{ADC} Configuration}]
# ********************************************* #
# ADC                                           #
# ********************************************* #
CONFIG_ADC=y
CONFIG_ADC_NRFX_SAADC=y
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Debug and Logging - \textit{UART}:}
\subsubsection{Devicetree:}
The \textit{UART} description in the application \textit{DT} overlay is described in listing  \ref{lst:uart_def}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:uart_def},caption={\textit{DT} \textit{UART} Description}]
&uart0 {
	status = "okay";
	current-speed = <115200>;
	pinctrl-0 = <&uart0_default>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&uart0_sleep>;
	pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
};
\end{lstlisting}

The \textit{UART} description from the listing \ref{lst:uart_def} shows new kind of propriety which is the \codeword{pinctrl} node. This node must be defined in a node external to the \textit{UART} node as shown in the listing \ref{lst:uart_pinctrl}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:uart_pinctrl},caption={\textit{DT UART} Pinctrl Description}]
&pinctrl {

	uart0_default: uart0_default {
		group1 {
			psels = <NRF_PSEL(UART_TX, 0, 6)>;
		};
		group2 {
			psels = <NRF_PSEL(UART_RX, 0, 7)>;
			bias-pull-up;
		};
	};

	uart0_sleep: uart0_sleep {
		group1 {
			psels = <NRF_PSEL(UART_TX, 0, 6)>,
				<NRF_PSEL(UART_RX, 0, 7)>;
			low-power-enable;
		};
	};
};
\end{lstlisting}

As shown in the listing \ref{lst:uart_pinctrl}, a peripheral can use two different \textit{pinctrl} definitions at the same time. This is a very useful tool that allows you to define different definitions of a specific peripheral depending on the mode it is used in, for example, normal mode and low-power-mode.

\subsubsection{Kconfig:}

When using \textit{UART}, it is possible to enable \textit{UART} interrupt driven configuration using the command described in the listing \ref{lst:uart_conf}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={lst:uart_conf},caption={Application \textit{UART} Configuration}]
# ******************************************** #
# UART Interrupt support                       #
# ******************************************** #
CONFIG_UART_INTERRUPT_DRIVEN=y
\end{lstlisting}

Listings \ref{lst:log_conf} and \ref{lst:debug_conf} illustrates the application configuration of \textit{Logging} and \textit{Debugging} options:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={lst:log_conf},caption={Application \textit{Logging} Configuration}]

CONFIG_DEBUG_COREDUMP=n
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Serial Bus - \textit{I2C}:}
\subsubsection{Devicetree:}
The definition and configuration of the \textit{I2C} driver is very similar to that of \textit{UART} and is shown in listings \ref{lst:i2c_def} and \ref{lst:i2c_pinctrl}:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:i2c_def},caption={\textit{DT I2C} Description}]
&i2c1 {
    compatible = "nordic,nrf-twim";
	status = "okay";
    pinctrl-0 = <&i2c1_default>;
    /* sleep state (only applicable if CONFIG_PM_DEVICE=y) */
    pinctrl-1 = <&i2c1_sleep>;
    /* state assigned to each pinctrl-N property by index */
    pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
    clock-frequency = <I2C_BITRATE_STANDARD>;
};

&i2c2 {
    status = "disabled";
};
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:i2c_pinctrl},caption={\textit{DT I2C} Pinctrl Description}]
&pinctrl {
    /* configuration for i2c1 device, default state */
	i2c1_default: i2c1_default {
		group1 {
			psels = <NRF_PSEL(TWIM_SDA, 0, 8)>,
				<NRF_PSEL(TWIM_SCL, 0, 9)>;
		};
	};

	i2c1_sleep: i2c1_sleep {
		group1 {
			psels = <NRF_PSEL(TWIM_SDA, 0, 8)>,
				<NRF_PSEL(TWIM_SCL, 0, 9)>;
			low-power-enable;
		};
	};
};
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Kconfig:}
Similar to the \textit{ADC} configuration, the \textit{I2C} configuration on the \textit{nRF9160} requires to enable both \textit{I2C} and \textit{I2C NRFX} \textit{APIs}, as shown in the listing \ref{lst:i2c_conf}:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={lst:i2c_conf},caption={Application \textit{I2C} Configuration}]
# ********************************************* #
# I2C                                           #
# ********************************************* #
CONFIG_I2C=y
CONFIG_I2C_NRFX=y
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Serial Bus - \textit{SPI}:}
Nearly identical to the definition and configuration of the \textit{I2C} \textit{API}, the \textit{SPI} definition and configuration is illustrated in listings \ref{lst:spi_def} to \ref{lst:spi_conf}:
\subsubsection{Devicetree:}
The \textit{DT} application overlay has a small difference from the \textit{I2C} which is the additional \textit{LS0XX} display driver definition as shown in the listing \ref{lst:spi_def}. The \textit{LS0XX} display driver definition is used to configure the display specifications such as width, height and serial communication max frequency.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:spi_def},caption={\textit{DT SPI} Description}]
&spi3 {
    status = "disabled";
};

&spi2 {
	compatible = "nordic,nrf-spim";
	status = "okay";
    cs-gpios = <&gpio0 28 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>, 	//Display scs
				<&gpio0 20 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;	//Accelerometer scs
	pinctrl-0 = <&spi2_default>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&spi2_sleep>;
	pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
	ls0xx: ls0xx@0 {
		compatible = "sharp,ls0xx";
		label = "DISPLAY";
		spi-max-frequency = <2000000>;
		width = <160>;
		height = <68>;
		reg = <0>;
	};
};
\end{lstlisting}

\pagebreak

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:spi_pinctrl},caption={\textit{DT SPI} Pinctrl Description}]
&pinctrl {
	spi2_default: spi2_default {

\end{lstlisting}
\;\\[-50pt]
\subsection{Motor Driver:}
The motor driving functionality of the \textit{LTEWatch} application requires macros definitions to describe \textit{GPIOs} pin used to drive motors and also uses \textit{aliases} node to share \textit{GPIOs} that are also defined as LEDs. The definition of the \codeword{zephyr,user} node and the \codeword{aliases} node is illustrated in the listing \ref{lst:motor_prop_def}:
\subsubsection{Devicetree:}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C,label={lst:motor_prop_def},caption={\textit{DT Motor} Proprieties and Aliases Description}]
/ {
	zephyr,user {
		// Clock Motors
		motor-max-number  = <3>;

	 };
	 aliases {
		motord3m1  = &led0;
		motord3com = &led1;
		motord3m2  = &led2;
	};
};
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Kconfig:}
The stepper motors used to display the time are driven using time-critical control signals. To ensure the accuracy and consistency of the motor control signal, the signal timing uses the \textit{RTC} as time reference. The \textit{RTC} driver configuration for the \textit{nRF9160} is shown in the \ref{lst:rtc_conf} listing:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=console,label={lst:rtc_conf},caption={Application \textit{RTC} Configuration}]
# ******************************************** #

\section{Overview of \textit{LTEWatch} Application Software}

To provide a better idea of the developed small watch application, the project structure is illustrated in project trees \ref{tree:LTEWatchAppStruct} to \ref{tree:LTEWatchAppStruct6}.\\

In the next project trees, the flowing color-code is used:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Blue}} : Unmodified source files imported from other applications
\item \textbf{\textcolor{orange}{Orange}} : Slightly modified source files imported from other applications, most current modification is adaptation to \textit{Zephyr RTOS}
\item \textbf{\textcolor{red}{Red}} :  New files created for the \textit{LTEWatch} application
\end{enumerate}

As shown in project trees \ref{tree:LTEWatchAppStruct} to \ref{tree:LTEWatchAppStruct6} many files are unmodified or slightly modified. Those files were provide by \textsc{Patrice Rudaz} from the \textit{HEVS} in order to make the software application development faster and easier. Those files come from two different projects from \textsc{Patrice Rudaz}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item MoskitoWatch Application
\item BikeBox Application\\
\end{itemize}

The unmodified files will not be presented in this chapter. The slightly modified files are most often just adapted for \textit{Zephyr RTOS} by replacing any timers with the \textit{Zephyr} kernel timer \textit{API} \textit{k\_timer} or replacing old \textit{GPIO} \textit{API} used by the new \textit{GPIO} and \textit{GPIOTE} \textit{APIs} from \textit{Zephyr RTOS} and also the implementation of the \textit{RTC} \textit{API} of \textit{MotorDriverHal} for \textit{Zephyr RTOS}.
