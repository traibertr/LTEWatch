\section*{About Nordic Semiconductor\cite{aboutNordicSemi}}

\textsc{Nordic Semiconductor} is a fabless semiconductor company from Norway specialized in wireless communication technologies and more particularly in \textit{Internet of things} (\textit{IoT}). The company is well known for its pioneer role in \textit{ultra low power wireless} solutions development such as \textit{Bluetooth Low Energy} (\textit{BLE}). They later implemented other technologies, such as: \textit{ANT+}, \textit{Thread}, \textit{Zigbee}, Low power and compact \textit{LTE-M/NB-IoT} cellular \textit{IoT} solutions, \textit{Wi-Fi technology}, \textit{GSMA}.

\section*{Goal of the project}

\textsc{Nordic Semiconductor} has developed the \textit{nRF91} family of \textit{cellular LTE-M/NB-IoT} communication devices. The goal of this Master Thesis is to develop the prototype of an analog wristwatch using a such device. There are many challenges to overcome in this project, to name just the most difficult ones as the mechanical as well the energy consumption constraints.

\pagebreak

\section*{Main tasks of the project}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Specification:} Elaborate the exact specification of the wristwatch (number of hands, battery lifetime, user interface, size, recharging mechanism, case)
\item \textbf{Antenna study:} The antenna of this device is particularly delicate. Since the communication is actually using 800 MHz, the antenna can not be as small as one would like it. So there has to be done a study how to solve this problems showing several innovative approaches how to solve this problem. At the conclusion of the study, a solution has to chosen for later implementation.
\item \textbf{Hardware conception:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Component selection (Cellular communication, motors and so on)
	\item Schematic and PCB realization of a prototype board 
	\item Fabrication and electrical test of the prototype
\end{enumerate} 
\item \textbf{Software development}: Design and develop a simple watch application that must implement
\begin{enumerate}
\item Motorized clockâ€™s hands
\item Buttons
\item LCD screen
\item \textit{LTE-M/NB-IoT} data reception and transmission with MQTT
\item \textit{GNSS} signal reception for position tracking and smart-watch time accuracy
\item Battery monitoring, battery charging configuration and level monitoring
\item Accelerometer usage
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Prototype validation:} Test of the entire development
\item \textbf{Documentation:} Establish a technical report enabling further developments
\end{enumerate}
